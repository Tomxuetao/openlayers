# 10.4.0

With more than 40 pull requests, the 10.4 release brings performance improvements, bug fixes, better TypeScript generics and new features. New features include a convenience `Image` layer loader for debugging MapServer map files using the MapServer CGI API, and an experimental `WebGLVectorTile` layer.

### Upgrade notes

#### Deprecation of ol/layer/WebGLPoints

Use `ol/layer/WebGLVector` instead. Besides rendering points it will also render lines and polygons.
In most cases this is a drop-in replacement. To use filtering the style and filter have to be in a nested object.
```js
// Before
new WebGLPointsLayer({
  filter: ['between', ['get', 'year'], ['var', 'minYear'], ['var', 'maxYear']],
  style: {
    'circle-radius': 8,
    'circle-fill-color': 'blue',
  },
  source: vectorSource,
})

// After
new WebGLVectorLayer({
  style: {
    filter: ['between', ['get', 'year'], ['var', 'minYear'], ['var', 'maxYear']],
    style: {
      'circle-radius': 8,
      'circle-fill-color': 'blue',
    },
  },
  source: vectorSource,
})
```

#### `ol/style/webgl` module removal

WebGL renderers used to rely on the `WebGLStyle` type in the `ol/style/webgl` module. This is not the case anymore, all renderers now rely on `FlatStyle` from `ol/style/flat`.

```diff
-import type { WebGLStyle } from 'ol/style/webgl';
+import type { FlatStyle } from 'ol/style/flat';
```

#### ol-mapbox-style compatibility

This version of OpenLayers is only compatible with `ol-mapbox-style@12.4.0` or higher.

#### Returning false from a one-time listener added with `once`

Returning false from the listener function will now stop propagation, when the listener is added with `once`.
Previously this only worked with the `on` method.

#### The `filter` option for `WebGLPointsLayer` has changed

The filter option for the `WebGLPointsLayer` must now be specified alongside other options instead of being part of the `style` object. Note that the `WebGLPointsLayer` is not part of the stable API and is subject to breaking changes between major releases.

```js
// Before
new WebGLPointsLayer({
  style: {
    filter: ['between', ['get', 'year'], ['var', 'minYear'], ['var', 'maxYear']],
    'circle-radius': 8,
    'circle-fill-color': 'blue',
  },
  source: vectorSource,
})

// Now
new WebGLPointsLayer({
  filter: ['between', ['get', 'year'], ['var', 'minYear'], ['var', 'maxYear']],
  style: {
    'circle-radius': 8,
    'circle-fill-color': 'blue',
  },
  source: vectorSource,
})
```

### Get ready for future changes

We're planning to stop providing barrel files, which will impact how you import modules from OpenLayers. See [#16461](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/issues/16461) for details. To get your code ready for that upcoming change, you can already help us test the `replace-barrel-imports` codemod from the [@openlayers/codemod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openlayers/codemod) package.
